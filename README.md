1. **Fan Not Turning On:** One of the case fans was not turning on after installation.
2. **PC Powering Off Unexpectedly:** The PC would power off unexpectedly during use.

## Resolved Issues

1. **Fan Not Turning On:** I resolved the issue by buying a fan header for the non-functional fan.
2. **PC Powering Off Unexpectedly:** I discovered that some of the wires were not properly connected, and some other wires were being stretched too far. After re-securing the connections and adjusting the wiring, the issue was resolved.
